# P23 Quotebase
>Buddypress/Wordpress quotebase extension.  
##### adds a 'quotebase' to your wordpress and handles the taxonomies and URL's for the author/tag relation between the quotes.

my target is to make it accessable globally over the network with usable widgets to choose for the site admins

### CAUTION

You can use the 'functional' branch if you need to.
